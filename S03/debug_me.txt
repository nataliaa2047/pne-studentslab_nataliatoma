The bug is taking place because there's an error when trying to execute result 2, and that's specifically because of t1.
The reason why this happens is because, in result 2, t1 is zero, which means that t0 must be divided by zero, which is
not possible because division by zero is undefined, adn that's why the system directly detects it as an error. So, in
order to solve our problem, we need to check if t1 is equal to zero before doing the division and decide what the
program should return in that case, instead of letting it crash. For example, we can return an error message or another
specific value when t1 is zero.
